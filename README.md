# Welcome to bamazon!

This assignment tested our ability to use MySQL and Node.JS to create a live inventory of multiple items for sale. We had to use inquirer and make sure that the questions we were answering were being reflected in real time to the database

# Buy or Exit

Two options are available upon loading into the app: Buy or Exit. Buy lets you see the inventory and exit takes you out of the app.

# Pick Something to Buy

A list is displayed when you're done perusing the 10 items available in varying quantities you are prompted to pick one to buy.

# Entering a value

If you buy something and the app has enough stock to complete your purchase, it will tell you that your purchase is successful, tell you the price, and bring you back to the Buy or Exit screen.

# Next Purchase

If you select Buy again after purchasing something, you will notice that the values in the table reflect the new remaining stock
